# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw earlier, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)
```{r, cache=TRUE}
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))
glimpse(approval_polllist)
approval_polllist_fix <- approval_polllist %>% 
 mutate(
        modeldate = mdy(modeldate),
        startdate = mdy(startdate),
        enddate = mdy(enddate),
        createddate = mdy(createddate))
```
## Create a plot

Using this data we will calculate the average net approval rate (approve - disapprove) for each week since Trump got into office and create a plot that looks like this one.
```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r trump_net_approval_rate, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
trump_ci <- approval_polllist_fix %>% 
  mutate(year = year(enddate),
         week = week(enddate),
         net_approval = adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove) %>% 
  group_by(year, week) %>% 
  summarise(mean_approval = mean(net_approval),
            SD_approval = sd(net_approval),
            count_approval = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count_approval - 1),
            SE_approval = sd(net_approval) / sqrt(n()),
            margin_approval = t_critical * SE_approval,
            approval_low = mean_approval - margin_approval,
            approval_high = mean_approval + margin_approval)
ggplot(trump_ci, aes(x = week, y = mean_approval, colour = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~year) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "orange") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("orangered", "chartreuse3", "deepskyblue", "darkorchid1")) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymax = approval_high, ymin = approval_low), alpha = 0.1) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none", aspect.ratio = 1/3) + 
  xlim(c(0, 53)) + 
  ylim(c(-23, 7.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 13, 26, 39, 52),
                     limits = c(0, 52)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(-20.0, -17.5, -15.0, -12.5, -10.0, -7.5, -5.0, -2.5, 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5),
                     limits = c(-22.0, 7.5)) +
  labs (title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump",
        subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
        caption = "Source: FiveThirtyEight",
        x = "Week of the year",
        y = "Average Net Approval (%)")
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Next we will compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020).
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
trump_ci_compare <- trump_ci %>% 
  filter(year == 2020, week == c(15,34))
trump_ci_compare
```
We can see that confidence interval for week 15 is slightly narrower than that for week 34 due to a higher standard deviation driving a higher standard error. This may be due to a combination of data that was released in mid-August, including a not-improving COVID-19 situation in the United States coupled with disappointing economic data. The wider confidence interval results in a wider array of values over which we can be 95% confident represent the true share of the population that approves of the President.
