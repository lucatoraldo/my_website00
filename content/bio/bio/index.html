<h2>The early years</h2>
<p>I was born in 1996 in <strong>Rome</strong>, Italy. There, I grew up in a typical Italian family, composed by my mom, my dad and my two younger sisters.
I have always loved the thrill of exploring opportunities and taking the unconventional route. In high school I was the only student in my class to enroll in an exchange programme that took me to a small town outside <strong>New Orleans</strong>, USA, called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ponchatoula,+LA,+USA/@30.4442683,-90.4743455,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x86273b5793abe2a9:0xf5cd6f227634c1ac!8m2!3d30.4388041!4d-90.4414762">Ponchatoula</a>.
Since I was a child I have always loved sports and I have had the honor of representing Italy at several international competitions, both as a <em>swimmer</em> and as a member of the <em>Modern Pentathlon</em> team.</p>

<h2>University life and work experience</h2>
<p>After I graduated from high school I decided to enroll to <strong>Bocconi University</strong> in Milan. Towards the end of my bachelor degree I received an offer from <strong>UBS</strong>, a prestigious investment bank, which prompted me to take a gap year and experience first hand the finance world. Few months later, as my internship in the Milan office of the Swiss bank was coming to an end, I was lucky enough to receive an offer for an off-cycle internship at <strong>Macquarie Capital</strong> in London.
Currently, I am studying towards the <em>Master in Financial Analysis</em> at <strong>LBS</strong>, one of the most prestigious and renowned business schools in the globe.</p>
